// Normal proxying to the main thread runs into the possible issue of the main
// thread pumping the event queue while it blocks. That is necessary for e.g.
// WebGL proxying where both sync and async events must be received and run in
// order. With this class, only async events are allowed, and they are run in
// an async manner on the main thread, that is, with nothing else on the stack
// while they run (even if this event blocks on something, which causes the
// main event loop to run events, if another event like this arrives, it would
// be queued to run later, avoiding a collision).

// this class will spin up a pthread. You can then call invoke() to run code
// on that pthread. The work done on the pthread receives a callback method
// which lets you indicate when it finished working. The call to invoke() is
// synchronous, while the work done on the other thread can be asynchronous,
// which allows bridging async JS APIs to sync C++ code.
//
// This can be useful if you are in a location where blocking is possible (like
// a thread, or when using PROXY_TO_PTHREAD), but you have code that is hard to
// refactor to be async, but that requires some async operation (like waiting
// for a JS event).
